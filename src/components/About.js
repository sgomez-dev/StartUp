                        Hello! I'm Santiago GÃ³mez de la Torre Romero, a passionate and dedicated web developer. With a
                        profound love for coding and a creative mindset, I strive to create web experiences that are not
                        only
                        visually appealing but also highly functional.

                        My journey in web development began with a curiosity to understand how things work on the internet.
                        Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React transforming ideas into
                        interactive and responsive websites.
                    </p>
